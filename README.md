Overview
This project predicts employee salaries based on various features using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes data analysis and model building in Jupyter Notebooks, with Python as the supporting language.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of employee data
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Multiple machine learning regression models
Model evaluation and performance metrics
Visualizations for insights and results
Dataset
The dataset contains information about employees, such as experience, education, role, and current salary.
Note: Please provide or link to your dataset, or describe its schema here.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Sonukr27/Employee-Salary-Prediction.git
cd Employee-Salary-Prediction
Install dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook
Usage
Open the main notebook (e.g., Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb) in Jupyter.
Follow the steps in the notebook to explore the data, preprocess, train models, and make predictions.
You can modify the notebook to try different models or feature engineering approaches.
